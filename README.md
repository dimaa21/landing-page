# Adaptive landing page 

This repository contains the source code for an adaptive landing page, developed using a combination of HTML, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Gulp.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The landing page is structured and marked up using HTML5 for semantic and accessible content.

- **Sass**: For styling, we use Sass, a preprocessor for CSS that provides variables, nesting, and other powerful features to streamline the styling process.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is employed for responsive design, layout components, and a consistent user interface, making the page look great on various devices and screen sizes.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and provide dynamic functionality to the landing page.

- **Gulp**: Gulp is utilized as a task runner to automate processes such as compiling Sass, minifying CSS and JavaScript, optimizing images, and more.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile devices and desktops.

- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is integrated to create interactive features, such as smooth scrolling, form validation, and dynamic content updates.

- **Efficient Workflow**: Gulp automates common development tasks, helping to optimize and streamline the project's development process.
